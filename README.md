# OS
Operating System assignment ,where we had to create a bank simulation using threads
To run the program type in Make,after compiling type in the name
Ex: ./lift_sim 10 2
Here 10 is the biffer size but you dont have to worry about that since i defined that alr,t is time for sleep, the sleep duration
output.txt is the output file.
Note this will work properly in unix.
